# Determining-Probabilities-of-Handwriting-Formations-using-PGMs
The main objective of the project is to develop probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to determine probabilities of observations which are described by various variables. We have given characterization of the structure of letter pair ’th’, which has six random variables x1-x6 which take a set of discrete values. They can be used to determine whether a particular handwriting sample is common (high probability) or rare (low probability) and which in turn can be useful to determine whether a sample was written by a certain individual.
